# SkillPass - Decentralized Skills Validation & Investment Platform

SkillPass is a blockchain-based platform for validating professional skills through community endorsements backed by reputation staking. Users can showcase their expertise through soulbound NFT credentials while peers stake their reputation to validate skills and **earn real yield from skill owner job revenue**.

## Real Problem

- In Web3 or freelance environments, it's hard to know if someone is trustworthy.
- "Proving" knowledge depends on screenshots or portfolio links.
- Recommendations/references are centralized and unverifiable.
- Freelancers face distrust on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork.
- **No financial incentive for skill validators - just social proof.**

---

## Solution: SkillPass 

Credential and endorsement system with third-party reputation staking **plus real investment returns**.

---

## Use Cases

- Web3 devs validating technical knowledge with community backing.
- Translation, design, writing—where social proof matters more than a diploma.
- Mentors endorsing mentees with skin in the game.
- Web3 communities filtering who is reputable based on social staking.
- **Investors earning 15-45% APY from skill owner job completions.**

### How it works

1. User logs in with Civic Auth and creates their profile.
2. Adds skills (e.g., React, Solana dev, designer, translator, etc.).
3. Other users can "invest" in a skill, staking REPR tokens to validate.
4. **Skill owners complete jobs → 7% of revenue shared with investors.**
5. **Investors earn monthly yield from real skill monetization.**
6. Profiles get a dynamic social/professional score, publicly visible.
7. Everything is recorded in a soulbound NFT with validated skills and endorsements.

## Civic Integration

SkillPass uses [Civic Auth](https://docs.civic.com/integration/nextjs#auth-%2B-web3) for secure, Web3-native authentication. Civic enables users to log in with their wallet, verify identity, and access protected features. Here’s how Civic is integrated:

### 1. Civic Auth Plugin Setup
- Uses `@civic/auth-web3/nextjs` for Next.js.
- Configured in `next.config.ts`:

```ts
import { createCivicAuthPlugin } from "@civic/auth-web3/nextjs"
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
};

const withCivicAuth = createCivicAuthPlugin({
  clientId: "YOUR_CIVIC_CLIENT_ID"
});

export default withCivicAuth(nextConfig)
```
- If using JS config, remove the type annotation.

### 2. Frontend Provider
- The app wraps its layout with the Civic Auth provider:

```tsx
import { CivicAuthProvider } from "@civic/auth/nextjs";

function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <CivicAuthProvider>
      {children}
    </CivicAuthProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. User Context & Wallet Registration
- Uses Civic’s React hooks (`useUser`) to access the authenticated user.
- On login, user wallet addresses (Ethereum/Solana) are registered via `/api/wallet/register`.
- If a user doesn’t have a wallet, the app can auto-create one using Civic’s embedded wallet.

### 4. API Route Protection
- API routes and pages that require authentication use Civic’s session/context to check for a valid user.
- Example: Only authenticated users can create skills, invest, or endorse.

### 5. Web3 + Auth
- Civic Auth is used with MetaMask and Solana wallets for seamless Web3 login.
- The user’s wallet address is used as their unique identifier across the platform and for blockchain actions.

### 6. Session Management
- Civic handles PKCE, token storage, and session refresh automatically.
- The backend can access the authenticated user via Civic’s `getUser` helper in API routes.

### 7. Logout & Security
- Logout is handled via Civic’s logout endpoint, which clears tokens and redirects the user.
- All sensitive actions (minting, investing, profile updates) require an active Civic session.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Docker & Docker Compose
- MetaMask: Users need MetaMask for blockchain interactions
- Sepolia Network: App automatically prompts network switching

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vict0rcarvalh0/civic-hackathon.git
cd src/skillpass
```
### 2. Install dependencies:
This project has some peer dependency conflicts. Use the --force flag to resolve them.

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Set up environment variables:
The application requires several environment variables to run correctly.

- Copy the example environment file:
```bash
    cp .env.example .env
```

- Get a Civic Client ID: You need to register your application with Civic to get a Client ID. You can sign up at auth.civic.com.

- Open the .env file and replace YOUR_CIVIC_CLIENT_ID_HERE with your actual Civic Client ID. 

### 4. Database Setup

Start PostgreSQL with Docker:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Set up database schema and seed data:
```bash
npm run db:setup
```

This will:
- Install dependencies
- Generate Drizzle migrations
- Create database tables
- Seed with sample users, skills, and endorsements

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.
