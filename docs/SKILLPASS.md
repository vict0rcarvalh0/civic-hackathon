# Skills passport with reputation staking for credibility


A skills passport with reputation staking for decentralized talent validation.

---

### Problem

Freelancers and creators face the challenge of proving competence. Resumes and online profiles are centralized, easy to fake, and unreliableâ€”especially in Web3, where identities are pseudonymous.

---

### Solution

SkillPass is a platform where users can:

- Create a decentralized profile using Civic Embedded Wallet.
- Add skills as soulbound NFTs.
- Receive endorsements from other users who stake tokens or reputation on their skills.
- Build on-chain, third-party-validated reputation with real skin in the game.

Endorsing involves risk: if the endorsed person cheats or underdelivers, the validator can lose their stake. This creates crypto-economic trust in the skill validation process.

### How it works

1. User logs in with Civic wallet and creates their SkillPass profile.
2. Adds skills like Solidity, UX Design, Translation, etc.
3. A peer or mentor can endorse that skill, staking tokens as collateral.
4. Skills and endorsements become soulbound NFTs, forming a public reputation profile.
5. If a user acts in bad faith, endorsers can be penalized.
